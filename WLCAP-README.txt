#########################################--README - Windows Log Collector And Parser--############################################

The Purpose of WLCAP is to automate the collection and parsing of audit logs on Windows7/Server 2008 and newer Operating Systems. 
By default, WLCAP will determine if the system is on a domain or not. If it is on a domain, it queries the Domain for a list of 
systems and runs against the systems found. WLCAP first collects the logs from each system and then parses the logs. If unable to 
reach a system, WLCAP will report the failure to the screen in yellow and write it to the report. If no domain is found, WLCAP 
will run against the local system. WLCAP is also capable of reading a list of hosts if defined. In each case if WLCAP is unable 
to save, clear, or backup the logs, it will report the failure to the screen in red and write it to the report.

Configuring WLCAP:
#######################


NOTES: 
For domain systems, the system that the script is ran from should be able to ping the target systems and access the default admin share (C$) of all target systems in order for the script to run successfully. Ensure the following is configured on all systems. 
 
	-Configure the following predefined Windows Firewall rules (Inbound) in your default domain policy or custom policy that is applied to all domain systems.: 
		Remote event log management (RPC) 
		Remote event monitor (RPC) 
		Remote service management (RPC) 
		ICMPv4 (ping)
		ICMPv6 (if applicable)
		File and Print share 

	-RPC service is running 
	-The config file must be located in the same directory as the script. 
	-The ImportExcel zip and folder (after the script extracts it) must be located in the same directory as the script. 
	-Windows disables powershell script execution by default. For WLCAP to work, script execution must be turned on. Do this by opening a powershell window as Admin and enter the following: 
		set-executionpolicy -force unrestricted


WLCAP has a config file named "WLCAP.cfg". Use this file to configure the storage location of the logs and more. See available options below.

[Script Config]

ERROR_ACTION_PREFERENCE
	This setting is for debugging purposes. Set it to no value (i.e. "ERROR_ACTION_PREFERENCE=") to see powershell errors. 
        This setting will be set to "ERROR_ACTION_PREFERENCE=SilentlyContinue" as a default. This surpresses powershell errors.



ENABLE_BACKUP_ARCHIVE
	This setting enables/disables the ability to designate an additional server/path to store a backup copy of the event 
	logs. This is not needed if the	server/path designated in LOG_ARCHIVE is backed up (i.e. backed up to tape). Set this to 
	enabled to create a backup of the event logs in another locaton (Must put a valid path in BACKUP_ARCHIVE in the 
	[Folder Locations] section below). This setting will be set to "ENABLE_BACKUP_ARCHIVE=disabled" as a default.



ENABLE_HOST_FILE
	This setting enables/disables the ability to define a list of systems in a text file to run against (Must put a vailid file 
	path in the HOST_FILE setting in the [Folder Locations] section below i.e. "HOST_FILE=C:\temp\computers.txt"). This setting
	will be set to "ENABLE_HOST_FILE=disabled" as a default.



ENABLE_HOST_DIFF
	This setting enables/disables the ability to check the accuracy of the host file against a domain computer query and 
	vice-versa (Default is disabled). Must be in a domain environment for this to work. Systems found in the domain query that 
 	are not in the host file will be written to the report to show the addition of system(s) to the domain. Add the new system(s) 
	to the host file to make the message(s) go away. If systems are found in the host file and not in the domain query, then it 
	will be written to the report to show the need to cleanup the host file.
	NOTE: ENABLE_HOST_FILE and HOST_FILE must be defined.


 
ENABLE_TEXT_REPORT
	This setting enables/disables the ability to generate a text report (.txt file). This is enabled by default. Enabling only
	one output option (either ENABLE_TEXT_REPORT or ENABLE_EXCEL_REPORT) will speed up the amount of time the script takes to run. 



ENABLE_EXCEL_REPORT
	This setting enables/disables the ability to generate a Microsoft Excel report (.txt file). This requires PowerSHell 5.1 or 
	higher. This is enabled by default. Enabling only one output option (either ENABLE_TEXT_REPORT or ENABLE_EXCEL_REPORT) 
	will speed up the amount of time the script takes to run.



[Folder/File Names]

LOG_FOLDER
	This setting defines the name of the local folder where event logs are temporarily stored until moved to the server 
	(LOG_ARCHIVE). This folder is used on each system for which the event logs are collected. A folder name is required to be 
	defined. If the folder does not exist, it will be created. Please ensure that this folder is locked down to Administrators 
	only and has auditing set since it will potentially have event log files in it. The setting will be set to 
 	"LOG_FOLDER=Audit_Logs".



OUTPUT_FILE=weekly-output.txt
	This setting defines the name of the report file that is generated by WLCAP. It can be named to anything. By default, a 
	date and time will proceed this name and cannot be changed. This setting will be set to "OUTPUT_FILE=weekly-output.txt"
	as a default.



[Folder Locations]

LOG_ARCHIVE
	This setting defines the central location for the logs to be stored. This can be a local path or a network path. This 
	setting will be set to "LOG_ARCHIVE=C:\Audit_Logs" as a default.



BACKUP_ARCHIVE
	This setting defines the backup location for the logs to be stored (Must set ENABLE_BACKUP_ARCHIVE to enbabled 
	"ENABLE_BACKUP_ARCHIVE=enabled"). This is not needed if the server/path designated in LOG_ARCHIVE is backed up 
	(i.e. backed up to tape). Set this to a valid path to create a backup of the event logs in another locaton. This setting will 
	be set to "BACKUP_ARCHIVE=" (blank) as a default.


 
OUTPUT_FOLDER
	This setting defines the report folder location where the reports are stored. It can be named to anything. The setting will 
	be set to "OUTPUT_FOLDER=C:\Audit_Logs\Audit_Output" as a default.



HOST_FILE
	This setting defines the path to a file with a list of systems to run against (Must set ENABLE_HOST_FILE to enabled
	"ENABLE_HOST_FILE=enabled"). By default, this will be set "to HOST_FILE=" (blank) and WLCAP will run locally or domain wide
	(depending if a domain was found).

Running WLCAP:
###################
To run WLCAP, either right-click on WLCAPx.x.ps1 (where x.x is the version number) and click "Run with PowerShell" or open a 
powershell console, cd to the directory that contains WLCAP and type ".\WLCAPx.x.ps1" (Note: WLCAP will have to be invoked from an 
existing powershell console in order to specify the parameters).
        
Parameters:
	-ComputerName
		This parameter allows WLCAP to run on a specified system. Syntax is: ".\WLCAPx.x.ps1 -ComputerName SystemX" (where x.x
		is the version number and SystemX is the computername)
	
	-ParseOnly
		This parameter allows WLCAP to parse logs found in the LOG_ARCHIVE folder. This is usefull if logs had to be manually
		collected. Just place the logs in the LOG_ARCHIVE folder and run WLCAP with the -ParseOnly parameter to parse the logs.
		Syntax is: ".\WLCAPx.x.ps1 -ParseOnly" (where x.x is the version number)
       
    -CollectOnly
       	This parameter allows the collection of logs without parsing. This can be usefully if parsing does not need to be done or will be done at a later time. Syntax is: ".\WLCAPx.x.ps1 -CollectOnly" (where x.x is the version number)
    
	-schTask 
        This parameter creates a scheduled task to run WLCAP. This defaults to using the system account which works fine for standalone systems (SUSA, MUSA), however, must be changed if running across a domain. To do this, go into Task Manager and find the WLCAP task, open it and change the user from SYSTEM to a domain account with admin rights. Syntax is: .\WLCAPx.x.ps1 -schTask (where x.x is the version number)

|                      -Added a path check in addition to the ping check for system availability                                     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 2.1                  -Fixed issue with running the script from a remote system and saving the logs on a        01-07-16            | 
|                       system that is being processed.                                                                              |                                          
|                      -Added Help Content (To see type Get-Help .\WLCAPx.x.ps1)                                                     |
|                      -Added a check to report if the EventLog was not cleared                                                      |
|                      -Updated list of Event IDs to more accurately show what is being parsed. Some Event                           |
|                       IDs were removed because the events would never be generated in a DSS compliant setting.                     |
|                      -Added a list of Event IDs captured to the README                                                             |
|                      -Fixed issue with auto rotated application and system logs being put in the parsing                           |
|                       folder and not directly in their respective folder.                                                          |
|                      -Separated the successful/failed screen unlock events from the successful/failed                              |
|                       logon sections of the report. Successful/Failed screen unlock events will have their                         |
|                       own section in the report. This helps clean up the successful/failed logon section of                        |
|                       the report for large environments.                                                                           | 
|                      -Removed Type 7 (Screen Unlock) 4634 (Logoff) events from the report. These events are                        |
|                       generated simultaneous to and as a result of a Type 7 (Screen Unlock) 4624 (Logon).                          | 
|                       Therefore, the events have no value.                                                                         |
|                      -Added the parsing of the System log (Event ID 1074) for Shutdowns. The Security log does                     |
|                       not provide a shutdown event.                                                                                |
|                      -Added logic to parse event IDs 1100, 4739, and 4906. The Event IDs were being pulled but                     |
|                       not parsed.                                                                                                  |

|                      -Added Unclassified headers and footers in the report output as well as a "(U)"                               |
|                       in the log file and report file names.                                                                       |
|                      -Made the collection portion of the script more verbose to show filenames and filepaths                       |

|                      -Added SYSTEM as the user for event IDs 1100, 4608, 4719, 4739, 4906, 5024, 5025 as                           |
|                       there is no user associated with the events.                                                                 |
|                      -Filtered out 4625 network logon events generated by SYSTEM                                                   |

|                      -Changed over to start-bitstransfer instead of copy-item to show progress for large files                     |
|                      -Updated 1074 filter to include support for windows 10, server 2016 and newer                                 |
